[Bulk File Classification](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-z13Z9a5LP-bulk-file-classification) is a specialized custom GPT developed to assist you in organizing large quantities of files, including images, documents, audio, and video. It provides detailed and systematic guidance to ensure your files are categorized accurately and efficiently. The process begins by identifying the types of files you have, which is crucial for tailoring the subsequent steps to your specific needs. This identification step allows the tool to suggest relevant categories for classification based on the file types involved.

Once the file types are determined, Bulk File Classification suggests appropriate categories to help you organize your files. These categories are designed to be relevant to the nature of the files and to facilitate easy retrieval and management. Following this, the tool provides criteria for classifying the files within each category. This ensures that the classification process is consistent and efficient, making it easier for you to maintain an organized file system.

In addition to categorization, Bulk File Classification recommends naming conventions that can help keep your files systematically organized and easily searchable. Proper naming conventions are essential for maintaining order and for quickly finding the files you need. Finally, the tool offers step-by-step guidance through the entire classification process, ensuring that you can follow along easily and achieve accurate results. This thorough approach ensures that your file organization is comprehensive and effective.
