[Bulk File Classification](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-z13Z9a5LP-bulk-file-classification) is a specialized custom GPT developed to assist you in organizing large quantities of files, including images, documents, audio, and video. It provides detailed and systematic guidance to ensure your files are categorized accurately and efficiently. The process begins by identifying the types of files you have, which is crucial for tailoring the subsequent steps to your specific needs. This identification step allows the tool to suggest relevant categories for classification based on the file types involved.

Once the file types are determined, Bulk File Classification suggests appropriate categories to help you organize your files. These categories are designed to be relevant to the nature of the files and to facilitate easy retrieval and management. Following this, the tool provides criteria for classifying the files within each category. This ensures that the classification process is consistent and efficient, making it easier for you to maintain an organized file system.

In addition to categorization, Bulk File Classification recommends naming conventions that can help keep your files systematically organized and easily searchable. Proper naming conventions are essential for maintaining order and for quickly finding the files you need. Finally, the tool offers step-by-step guidance through the entire classification process, ensuring that you can follow along easily and achieve accurate results. This thorough approach ensures that your file organization is comprehensive and effective.

Exporting the classified data is a crucial feature of the Bulk File Classification process. Once files are identified and categorized, the system can generate a comprehensive dataset that details the classification results. This dataset can be exported in various formats, such as CSV or Excel, allowing users to easily access, share, and analyze the information. The exported data includes file names, categories, subcategories, and other relevant metadata, providing a well-organized overview of the entire file collection. This functionality enhances data management, facilitates further processing, and ensures that users maintain a clear and structured record of their classified files.

'Bulk File Classification' leverages image recognition technology to analyze and categorize large quantities of image files efficiently. By employing advanced algorithms, it can identify and classify images based on various attributes such as content, context, and metadata. This process involves extracting visual features from each image, comparing them against a vast database of known patterns, and assigning appropriate categories. The system can recognize objects, scenes, and even text within images, making it versatile for different classification needs. This ensures that users can organize their image files systematically, improving retrieval and management. Additionally, the tool can handle diverse file formats and provide detailed instructions for users to follow, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the classification process.

### Example Usage

Jane has a mixed collection of files including images from her vacation, work documents, music tracks, and a few video clips. She wants to organize these files systematically.

1. **Identify File Types**:
   Jane selects "E. Mixed (multiple file types)" as she has various types of files.

2. **Suggest Categories**:
   - For images, Jane decides on categories like "Vacation", "Family", "Events".
   - For documents, she chooses "Work Reports", "Invoices", "Presentations".
   - For audio, she selects "Music", "Podcasts".
   - For videos, she opts for "Vacation Clips", "Tutorials".

3. **Criteria for Classification**:
   - Images: Jane uses date taken and location.
   - Documents: She uses the date created and project name.
   - Audio: She sorts by artist and album.
   - Video: She classifies by date recorded and subject matter.

4. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Images: YYYYMMDD_Location_Vacation.jpg (e.g., 20230415_Paris_Vacation.jpg)
   - Documents: YYYYMMDD_Project_Report.docx (e.g., 20230501_ProjectX_Report.docx)
   - Audio: Artist_Album_TrackNumber.mp3 (e.g., Coldplay_AHeadFullOfDreams_01.mp3)
   - Video: YYYYMMDD_Vacation_Beach.mp4 (e.g., 20230416_Vacation_Beach.mp4)

5. **Step-by-Step Guidance**:
   Jane follows the detailed instructions:
   - She gathers all her files into one folder on her computer.
   - She sorts them into separate folders: Images, Documents, Audio, Video.
   - Within each main folder, she creates subfolders based on the categories (e.g., Images/Vacation, Documents/Work Reports).
   - She moves each file into its corresponding subfolder.
   - She renames the files according to the naming conventions provided, ensuring that each file is easily identifiable.

By following these steps, Jane efficiently organizes her files, making them easier to find and manage in the future.

### File Size Limits

File Size: Each individual file can be up to 100 MB in size.

Total Number of Files: Multiple files can be uploaded at once, but the total combined size should not exceed 100 MB per upload.

#
### File Compression

Compressing larger files is a crucial process in managing data efficiently. By reducing the size of files, compression helps save storage space and facilitates faster data transfer, especially over the internet. This process involves encoding information using fewer bits, which can be achieved through various algorithms such as ZIP, RAR, and 7-Zip. These algorithms use techniques like lossless and lossy compression; the former retains the original data intact, while the latter reduces file size by eliminating some data. Compression is widely used in various fields, from sending large email attachments to archiving data and optimizing website performance. Effective compression ensures that large files can be stored, transmitted, and accessed more efficiently, making it an essential tool in modern data management.
